I will now attempt to visualise the death rate of patients from different age groups and genders based on whether they had pre-existing medical conditions or not and on whether they were admitted into the ICU or not. The CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data(https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf) has de-identified patient data on cases recorded in the United States. There are well over 3 million records so I will use the `vroom` package to load it. The columns of interest in the dataset are:

`sex`: sex of the patient

`age group`: The age group that the patient belongs to (groups of 10)

`icu_yn`: whether the patient was admitted to the ICU or not (Yes/No)

`medcond_yn`: whether the patient had a medical condition prior to being admitted (Yes/No)

`death_yn`: whether the patient died or not (Yes/No)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

#using the vroom package to load the data and the janitor package to clean column names
covid_data <- vroom(url)%>% 
  clean_names()


```
I will now produce a plot of Covid-19 death rate % grouped by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not. In order to do this, I first have to clean the variables `medcond_yn`, `death_yn`, `sex` and `age_group` since all of them contain NA values. In some cases the missing values are stored in character form using the words *Other*, *Missing* or *Unknown* so I will also have to clean these values from the dataset.  I have named the cleaned dataset `death_rate_medcond` and will use it to create the visualisation. 

```{r, covid_death_rate1, fig1, fig.width = 12, fig.height=7}
#storing names of missing values in a vector
val_to_remove=c("Missing", "Unknown", "Other", NA)

death_rate_medcond <- covid_data %>% 
  select(medcond_yn, death_yn, sex, age_group) %>% 
  #removing missing and unknown values from the variables of interest
  filter(!(death_yn %in% val_to_remove) ,
         !(medcond_yn %in% val_to_remove), 
         !(sex %in% val_to_remove),
         !(age_group %in% val_to_remove)
  ) %>%
  #assigning more meaningful names to variable medcond_yn
  mutate(death_bool = ifelse(death_yn=="Yes", 1, 0), 
         co_mor= ifelse(medcond_yn=="Yes", "With comorbidities", "Without comorbidities")) %>% 
  group_by(age_group, sex, co_mor) %>% 
  #calculating death rate
  summarise(death_r = prop(death_bool))

ggplot(death_rate_medcond, aes(x=death_r, y=age_group)) +
  geom_col(fill="#1b5596", alpha=0.6) +
  #faceting by sex and presence of co-morbidities
  facet_grid(rows= vars(co_mor), cols= vars(sex))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme_bw()+
  #adding text to show the death rate % next to the bars on the graph
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_r*100, 2)), position=position_dodge(width=0.8), hjust=-0.05, size=3)+
  labs (
    title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and presence of comorbidities",
    caption="Source: CDC"
  )+
  theme(
    axis.title.x=element_blank(), #removing x and y axis labels
    axis.title.y=element_blank()
  )



```

From the graph above we can see that men above the age of 80 with comorbidities have the highest death rate (67.2%). The death rate for men appears to be higher in most age groups regardless of whether they have a pre-exisiting medical condition or not. Moreover, we can clearly see that COVID-19 has caused a higher death rate in patients with comorbidities than in those with no pre-exisiting medical condition, both among men and women. 


Next, I will now produce a plot of Covid-19 death rate % grouped by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not. I will now produce a new cleaned dataset `death_rate_icu` and use it to create the visualisation. 

```{r, covid_death_rate2, fig2, fig.width = 12, fig.height=7}


death_rate_icu <- covid_data %>% 
  select(icu_yn, death_yn, sex, age_group) %>% 
  #removing missing and unknown values from the variables of interest
  filter(!(death_yn %in% val_to_remove) ,
         !(icu_yn %in% val_to_remove), 
         !(sex %in% val_to_remove),
         !(age_group %in% val_to_remove)
  ) %>%
  #assigning more meaningful names to variable icu_yn
  mutate(death_bool = ifelse(death_yn=="Yes", 1, 0), 
         icu= ifelse(icu_yn=="Yes", "Admitted to ICU", "No ICU")) %>% 
  group_by(age_group, sex, icu) %>% 
  #calculating death rate
  summarise(death_rate = prop(death_bool))

ggplot(death_rate_icu, aes(x=death_rate, y=age_group)) +
  geom_col(fill="#f2695c", alpha=0.7) +
  #faceting by sex and whether patient was admitted to the ICU
  facet_grid(rows= vars(icu), cols= vars(sex))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme_bw()+
  #adding text to show the death rate % next to the bars on the graph
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate*100, 2)), position=position_dodge(width=0.8), hjust=-0.05, size=2)+
  labs (
    title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU",
    caption="Source: CDC"
  )+
  theme(
    axis.title.x=element_blank(),#removing x and y axis labels
    axis.title.y=element_blank()
  )



```

The death rate for patients admitted into the ICU is much higher than for those not admitted across both genders. Again, men have a higher death rate when compared to women regardless of whether they were admitted into the ICU or not.

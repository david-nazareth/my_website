<p>The London data store (<a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires" class="uri">https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires</a>) provides us with data on the total number of Santander cycles hired by day, month and year since the scheme started on 30th July 2010. We can access the latest data from the site and store it in a temporary excel file. We will then clean the column names using clean_names() from the janitor package and extract the year, month and day from the day column using functions from the lubridate package.</p>

<p>The distribution of bike rentals for May and June 2020 appears to be more spread out when compared to previous years. This higher standard deviation in bike rentals in summar 2020 is as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown which changed the movement patterns of people in the city compared with previous years. People now use bikes rather than public transport for both essential travel and leisure.This explains some of the days in May and June that saw a high number of bikes being rented. However the lockdown has also caused bike rentals to be adversely affected on certain days with people having to work from home rather than office and not moving about as much.</p>
<p>In order to understand how monthly bike rentals varied during the COVID-19 lockdown compared with the average rentals since 2015, I have created a visualization with the monthly average shown in blue and the actual number of rentals in black. I used the geom_ribbon function to colour the band between the two lines red, if actual rentals is lower than expected rentals and green if actual rentals is above expected rentals.</p>

<p>One can clearly see a drastic decrease in the number of bikes hired from early February, 2020 onwards uptill the beginning of May. From then on, bike rentals have been slightly above the monthly average possibly due to people using them for leisure and as a safer alternative to public transport.</p>

<p>We used the median rather than the mean to calculate expected rentals since the median is less affected by the presence of outliers i.e days with a very high or very low number of bikes rented.</p>

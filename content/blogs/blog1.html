<p>The pandemic has impacted how people move in many of the world’s largest cities. People are working and studying from home and do not move about as much as they used to. The usage of public transport has gone down drastically as the public explore safer options to move about like personal vehicles and cycles. In this analysis, I will attempt to explore how the pandemic has affected the monthly and weekly rentals of Santander cycles in London by comparing it with the expected monthly rentals calculated using data on bike rentals over the last 5 years.</p>
<p>The London data store (<a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires" class="uri">https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires</a>) provides us with data on the total number of Santander cycles hired by day, month and year since the scheme started on 30th July 2010. We can access the latest data from the site and store it in a temporary excel file. We will then clean the column names using clean_names() from the janitor package and extract the year, month and day from the day column using functions from the lubridate package.</p>

<p>The distribution of bike rentals for May and June 2020 appears to be more spread out when compared to previous years. This higher standard deviation in bike rentals in summar 2020 is as a direct result of the COVID-19 lockdown which changed the movement patterns of people in the city compared with previous years. People now use bikes rather than public transport for both essential travel and leisure.This explains some of the days in May and June that saw a high number of bikes being rented. However the lockdown has also caused bike rentals to be adversely affected on certain days with people having to work from home rather than office and not moving about as much.</p>
<p>In order to understand how monthly bike rentals varied during the COVID-19 lockdown compared with the average rentals since 2015, I have created a visualization with the monthly average shown in blue and the actual number of rentals in black. I used the geom_ribbon function to colour the band between the two lines red, if actual rentals is lower than expected rentals and green if actual rentals is above expected rentals.</p>

<p>One can clearly see a drastic decrease in the number of bikes hired from early February, 2020 onwards uptill the beginning of May. From then on, bike rentals have been slightly above the monthly average possibly due to people using them for leisure and as a safer alternative to public transport.</p>
<p>Next I will compare weekly rentals in 2020 with the expected weekly rentals calculated using data from 2015-2019. The graph below represents the percentage change (positive or negative) from the expected weekly rentals.</p>

<p>The graph above paints a similar picture to that which we saw when we looked at actual vs expected monthly rentals during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Nobody really knows what the long term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be on the mobility patterns of people in cities but I think we can all agree that 2020 has been a very erratic year for public transportation.</p>

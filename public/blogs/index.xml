      <description>I will now attempt to visualise the death rate of patients from different age groups and genders based on whether they had pre-existing medical conditions or not and on whether they were admitted into the ICU or not. The CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data(https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf) has de-identified patient data on cases recorded in the United States. There are well over 3 million records so I will use the vroom package to load it.</description>

      <description>The London data store (https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires) provides us with data on the total number of Santander cycles hired by day, month and year since the scheme started on 30th July 2010. We can access the latest data from the site and store it in a temporary excel file. We will then clean the column names using clean_names() from the janitor package and extract the year, month and day from the day column using functions from the lubridate package.</description>

      <description>The main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the Wikipedia GDP page.
The GDP data we will look at is from the United Nationsâ€™ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today.</description>
